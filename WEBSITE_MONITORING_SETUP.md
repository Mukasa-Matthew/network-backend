# Simplified Website Monitoring Setup Guide

This guide provides multiple approaches to monitor website traffic on your MikroTik router, from simple to advanced.

## Method 1: Simple DNS Monitoring (Easiest)

This method only requires DNS logging and doesn't need web proxy configuration.

### Step 1: Enable DNS Logging
1. **Access your MikroTik router** via WinBox or SSH
2. **Navigate to**: System → Logging
3. **Add new rule**:
   - Topics: dns
   - Action: memory
   - Click "Apply"

### Step 2: Test DNS Logging
In the terminal/console, run:
```
/log print where topics~dns
```

You should see DNS queries from your network.

## Method 2: Basic Web Proxy (Recommended)

This is a simpler web proxy setup that should work on most MikroTik routers.

### Step 1: Enable Web Proxy
1. **Navigate to**: IP → Proxy → Settings
2. **Enable Web Proxy**:
   - Check "Enable Web Proxy"
   - Set Port: 8080
   - Click "Apply"

### Step 2: Configure Access
1. **Navigate to**: IP → Proxy → Access
2. **Add new rule**:
   - Src. Address: 0.0.0.0/0
   - Action: allow
   - Click "Apply"

### Step 3: Enable Logging
1. **Navigate to**: System → Logging
2. **Add new rule**:
   - Topics: web-proxy
   - Action: memory
   - Click "Apply"

### Step 4: Test Configuration
Run these commands to test:
```
/ip proxy print
/log print where topics~web-proxy
```

## Method 3: Alternative - Firewall Connection Monitoring

If web proxy doesn't work, we can monitor connections instead.

### Step 1: Enable Connection Logging
1. **Navigate to**: IP → Firewall → Filter Rules
2. **Add new rule**:
   - Chain: forward
   - Protocol: tcp
   - Dst. Port: 80,443
   - Action: log
   - Log: yes
   - Click "Apply"

### Step 2: Test Connection Logging
```
/log print where topics~firewall
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "No such command" errors
**Solution**: Your RouterOS version might be different. Try these alternative commands:

```
# Check RouterOS version
/system resource print

# Check available proxy commands
/ip proxy help

# Check available logging topics
/system logging print
```

### Issue 2: Web proxy not working
**Solution**: Try these steps:

1. **Check if proxy is supported**:
```
/ip proxy print
```

2. **If not supported, use Method 3** (Firewall Connection Monitoring)

3. **Alternative: Use simple DNS monitoring** (Method 1)

### Issue 3: No logs appearing
**Solution**: 

1. **Check logging configuration**:
```
/system logging print
```

2. **Generate some traffic**:
   - Have users browse websites
   - Wait 1-2 minutes
   - Check logs again

3. **Check log topics**:
```
/log print
```

### Issue 4: Permission denied
**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're logged in as admin
2. Try using WinBox instead of SSH
3. Check if your user has write permissions

## Quick Test Commands

Run these commands to test each method:

### Test DNS Monitoring:
```bash
# Check DNS logs
/log print where topics~dns

# Check DNS server
/ip dns print
```

### Test Web Proxy:
```bash
# Check proxy status
/ip proxy print

# Check proxy logs
/log print where topics~web-proxy
```

### Test Firewall Connections:
```bash
# Check active connections
/ip firewall connection print

# Check firewall logs
/log print where topics~firewall
```

## Alternative: Manual Configuration via WinBox

If command line doesn't work, try using WinBox GUI:

1. **Open WinBox** and connect to your router
2. **Go to IP → Proxy → Settings**
3. **Check "Enable Web Proxy"**
4. **Set port to 8080**
5. **Click Apply**

Then:
1. **Go to System → Logging**
2. **Click the "+" button**
3. **Set Topics to "web-proxy"**
4. **Set Action to "memory"**
5. **Click Apply**

## What to Do If Nothing Works

If you're still having issues, we can implement a **fallback monitoring system** that uses:

1. **DHCP lease monitoring** (see which devices are connected)
2. **Interface traffic monitoring** (see bandwidth usage)
3. **Simple connection counting** (see active connections)

Let me know which method works for you, or if you need the fallback system implemented.

## Next Steps

Once you get any of these methods working:

1. **Test the backend** to see if it can read the data
2. **Check the frontend** to see if data displays
3. **Configure additional monitoring** as needed

Which method would you like to try first, or do you need help with a specific error message?
